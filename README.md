# Google Analytics Download Tracker
ga-download-tracker.js

### Track file downloads using Google Analytics virtual pageviews

NB! This script isn't working yet. It still requires links to be in the following format to work: <a onclick="gadt.track(event, this);" href="/files/file.pdf">Download file</a>

The plan is to insert the onclick events automatically.

### Thanks

A big thanks to TechOctave, their project entourage.js was a big influence: https://github.com/techoctave/entourage
